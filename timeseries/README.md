 The main script loads historical data, preprocesses it, splits it into training and testing sets, creates sequences for the LSTM model, builds and trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance.

Usage
1. Prepare your data:

Place your historical data CSV file in the data directory. Ensure the file is named voo_historical_data.csv or update the file_path variable in the main function.

2. Run the main script:

python main.py

This will execute the entire pipeline, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
