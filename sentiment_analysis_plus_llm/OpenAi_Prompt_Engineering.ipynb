    "This script processes a dataset of financial news articles to generate summaries and sentiment analysis using the OpenAI API. It begins by reading the articles from a CSV file, cleaning the data by removing any entries with missing text, and ensuring that all entries in the `LLM_Output` column are in string format. The script then iterates through each article, sending the content to the OpenAI model with a prompt designed to generate a five-line summary, assess the sentiment towards a specific company, and evaluate the relevance of the article. The generated output is stored back in the dataset for further analysis or modeling.\n"

The code then filters out any rows where the `full_article` column contains missing values (`NaN`), ensuring that only complete articles are kept. After cleaning, the remaining number of articles is printed. Finally, the `LLM_Output` column is converted to a string type to ensure consistent data processing in later stages.\n"
